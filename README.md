## Project Goals

The aim of this website is to build a fully functional e-commerce site where users can purchase footwear and accessories, leave ratings, create accounts and view their order history.

## User Experience

### Target Audience

The target audience for this website is primarily young people interested in fashion and footwear. In particular...

1. Fashion forward students aged between 18-24.
2. Teenagers aged between 13-18.
3. Parents of teenagers and students looking to purchase gifts for their children.
4. Young people conscious of deals and student discounts, hunting down bargains.
5. Deal hunters looking for a good deal on footwear.
6. Young professionals looking for comfortable shoes.
7. Parents of young children looking to buy good quality but affordable shoes for their growing children.
8. Family members of young children looking to buy footwear-related gifts for seasonal occasions.

### User Stories

#### First-time users

1. As a first-time user, I want to able to navigate around the website in a way that is intuitive and easily understandable so I can browse freely.
2. As a first-time user, I want to be able to create an account so I can see all of my information at once.
3. As a first-time user, I want to be able to place an order without creating an account if I wish.
4. As a first-time user, I want to be able to search the product catalog

## Scope

## Design

### Database Design

<details>
    <summary>Why use ProductGroup and ProductType models?</summary>

For the data of product group (womens, mens and kids) and type (sandals, trainers, etc) I could have used character fields in the main Products model. Instead, I opted to create separate models to hold this data to limit human error. One could easily accidentally type in "men" instead of "mens" for example, leading to issues when sorting the products later on.

## Technologies Used

### Languages

### Frameworks, libraries and other tools

[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

- Sass was used as a CSS extension to speed up development of stylesheets. The features of Sass such as variables, mixins, nesting and seperation of logic was very helpful in this project. 

[Git](https://git-scm.com/)

- Git was used for version control within VSCode to push the code to GitHub.

[GitHub](https://github.com/)

- GitHub was used as a remote repository to store project code.

[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)

- All images used in the website apart from the logo were from the online copyright-free repository, Unsplash. See Credits for more information.

[Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/)

- Am I Responsive was used to create the multi-device mock-up you see at the start of this README.md file.

[Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

- VSCode was the IDE used to write the code for this project. The following extensions were used for this project:

- *markdownlint*: To keep consistent styling on markdown files.
- *SpellChecker*: To spell check markdown files.
- *TODO Highlight*: To keep track of outstanding tasks, bugs that need to be fixed and annotations throughout the development process.
- *Tokyo Night*: For syntax highlighting & styling of VSCode.
- *vscode-pdf*: To view the wireframes.pdf file within VSCode.
- *Terminal Tools*: Provides buttons among terminal for command shorthands, making interacting with the terminal faster.
- *Live Sass Compiler*: Watches for changes in scss files and compiles them to css files automatically. I've customised the settings to compile my .scss files into a singular .min.css file in my static directory.

[Tiny PNG](https://tinypng.com/)

- TinyPNG was used to compress images for improved website performance.

[Gorgias SKU Generator](https://www.gorgias.com/tools/sku-generator)

- Gorgias SKU Generator was used to generate SKU values. Please see [Database Design](#Database-Design) for more information on SKU architecture within the fixtures.
