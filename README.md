## Design

### Database Design

**Database physical model:**

This physical model contains all database collections, data types and relations to one another:

![Database physical model](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS4_Kicks/blob/main/docs/design/database_diagram.png)

#### Models

**Product model**

- Core model containing all information about products.
- Contains the fields: sku, name, description, product_group, product_type, product_brand, price, default_rating, image_url, image and has_sizes.
- The sku field naming convention is based on sku architecture principles. The first two letters are product type, e.g. "TRAINERS", the next two are brand, e.g. "NIKE", the next two are product grouping, e.g. "CHILDRENS, the next number the default rating, e.g. "3", and the last letters the colour, e.g. "BLUE". For example, the first product's sku is "TRANICH3BL". I learnt about sku architecture from this [blog post](https://www.shopify.co.uk/retail/what-is-a-sku-number) from Shopify. I sped up production of sku fields by using the [Gorgias SKU Generator](https://www.gorgias.com/tools/sku-generator).
- The image_url field is used to store the AWS s3 bucket url which holds the product's image.

**ProductType model**

- Contains all of the product types, for example Trainers, Daps, Brogues etc. These types are used to help users filter to which products they may be interested in.
- Contains the fields: name, friendly_name.
- This could have been a CharField in the Product model, but I opted to create separate models to hold this data to limit human error.

**ProductGroup model**

- Contains all of the product types, for example Mens, Womens etc. These groups are used to help users filter to which products would suit them.
- Contains the fields: name, friendly_name.
- This could have been a CharField in the Product model, but I opted to create separate models to hold this data to limit human error.

**Brand model**

- Contains all 54 brands whose products are used in this project.
- Contains the fields: name, friendly_name.
- This could have been a CharField in the Product model, but (a) I wanted to limit human error and (b) I was creating seperate views for a brands app so it made more sense to keep the Brand model in the same app rather than be part of Product in the products app.

**Review**

- Contains all product reviews left by users. Reviews can be left by regular users or superusers. Regular users can edit or delete their own reviews, while superusers can edit or delete any reviews. Going forward I would like to use this model to upload the default_rating field on the Product model to replace the admin-input of ratings and have users be able to quickly see an aggregated rating for the product as well as individual reviews.
- Contains the fields: text_review, star_rating, created_at, created_by, product

**Favourite**

- Stores products favourited by a specific user. 
- Contains the fields: product, created_by

**UserProfile**

- Contains delivery information and the user. 
- Contains the fields: user, default_phone_number, default_street_address1, default_street_address2, default_town_or_city, default_county,  default_postcode, default_country

**User**

- This is a model created by the Django allauth library.
- Contains the fields: username, password, first_name, last_name, is_staff, is_active, is_superuser, last_login, date_joined

**Order**

- Contains all key order information such as delivery information, shopping bag and total of order.
- Contains the fields: user_profile, order_number, full_name, email, phone_number, country, postcode, town_or_city, street_address_1, street_address_2, county, date, delivery_cost, order_total, grand_total, original_bag, stripe_pid

**OrderLineItem**

- Contains information about specific products in regards to orders being made.
- Contains the fields: order, product, product_size, quantity, lineitem_total

### Visual Design

#### Colour Scheme

The following colours were chosen to be the main colours of the website due to their association with youth culture and street fashion, particularly the yellow and purple. I wanted to create a vibrant and fun brand. 

![Colour scheme](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS4_Kicks/blob/main/docs/design/colour_scheme.png)

Other colours are used in other sections of the site such as a neon green or neutral grey, but these are the core colours.

#### Typography

The main heading font is Outfit (with generic sans-serif if font fails) and the main body text is Outfit, with a tertiary font of Rubik Mono One. [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used for the typography. I chose these fonts due to there high readability and comptability across browsers.

#### Imagery

All of the images used are fully copyright-free images (please see the [media.md](/docs/media.md) markdown file for more details). 

The imagery is fun, bright and vibrant product photography. Imagery is used a lot throughout the website to keep the website visually engaging and give users as much visual information about the product as possible.

**Feature 16: Filter products by rating**

All products can be filtered by rating to go from high to low. I decided against putting a low to high option because I don't see a reason why a user would wish to see the lowest rated item.

Going forward, I would like to apply more obvious styling to the selected params to let users know more clearly which filter they currently have selected if any.

## Bugs and Errors

- **Bug 1: Incorrect data types**: Product model throwing errors when attempting to make migration
- **Fix**:  Change attribute on an IntegerField from max_digits to the Django method MaxValueValidator. Add on_delete attribute to ForeignKeys. Add max_digits attribute to DecimalFields.
- **Bug 2: Searching FieldError**: When searching using the search bar Django would throw a FieldError and could not resolve 'name_icontains'.
- **Fix**: From consulting Django documentation I realised I had mistakenly only used one underscore (_) instead of two before 'icontains'.
- **Bug 3: No render of products by product_group**: My filtering method through product_group was not rendering the correct products to the HTML.
- **Fix**:Add .split() method to if statement within my product view.
- **Bug 4: Field Error on search feature**: After working successfully (see bug 2) the search feature became broken during development. When attemping to search Django would through a FieldError, 'Related Field has invalid lookup: icontains".
- **Fix**: Through research I discovered that in Django you can't use the Query object on ForeignKey database values. When I changed my product models to use a ForeignKey in place of the brand, it broke the search feature. I removed the ability to search by brand to fix this. This [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11754877/troubleshooting-related-field-has-invalid-lookup-icontains) on StackOverflow was particularly helpful in figuring this out.
- **Bug 5: Could not get both the product size and product quantity to display on template.**
- **Fix**: This involved a lot of trail and error and eventual chat to the CI support team. My first issue was that I couldn't pass the 'size' POST request data from the user to the database without manipulation of it as an integer. I then revisited the Boutique Ado code and implemented the if logic of the tutorial in my contexts.py Then the issue was twofold. 1) Through my template code I was inadvertently trying to render the entire item_data object in my code, rather than accessing just the quantity. 2) In my if statement of contexts.py I was accidentally passing the quantity value the item_data object instead of the quantity variable. Thank you to Code Institute for all their support on this bug.
- **Bug 6: Integrity Error raised on Django utilities**
- **Fix**: Data is my products model was throwing invalid foreign key errors. This was because I was trying to load the data in the incorrect order. I first changed the model name, migrated changes, then 'loaddata' in the correct order of operations.
- **Bug 7: /?product_type=socks URL not displaying any products**
- **Fix**: Investigating in the Admin dashboard I discovered that the product_type and product_brand values were contaminating each other, with the product_types only going up to 8 (socks was 9) and the rest of the data being filled in with brand names. I fixed this by moving the product_brand value in the model and fixtures, deleting the brands in the Admin dashboard and reloading the data in the appropriate order (brands first).
- **Bug 8: Inability to sort brands alphabetically by first letter**
- **Fix**: My original method of trying to sort the brands object by alphabet, then render according to first letter was using a custom template tag (|firstchar) and the zip() method on a python alphabet string and django object. See this image to see how this looked. The dual iteration loop didn't work as intended. I could render either the brand name or the alphabet string, not use them in logic to render brands organised by the string itself. I changed this methodology and used the regroup template tag to regroup the brands query set instead which worked successfully.
- **Bug 9: Stripe payment not going through**
- **Fix**: Stripe payments were not being received as Successful despite the checkout form submitting correctly. This was due to the code throwing a TypeError because I was inadvertently trying to add a float with a decimal when calculating the grand total to be submitted to Stripe. I wrapped the instance of my DELIVERY_COST variable in update_total function with a Decimal method to convert the type. This allowed the sum to be calculated correctly and payment to be submitted. 
- **Bug 10: On mobile view all pages had a blank bar of white space to the right of the screen that would trigger a horizontal scrollbar**
- **Fix**: I discovered this is a common bug with Bootstrap rows. To fix this I set a CSS rule for the root element that the 'overflow-x' be 'hidden'.
- **Bug 11: Failed migrations on brand model caused Django project to fail completely**
- **Fix**: When trying to migrate over the brand model from the products app to the brand app, I accidentally caused the whole project to fail on the server. The steps I took to fix the issue: (a) Reversed to a few commits previously (b) faked all previous migrations (c) reloaded all the data from the fixtures (d) make new migrations (e) opened a new branch to test migration attempt one step at a time. I believe I caused the bug by accidentally rewriting over an old migration which created a conflict within Django.
- **Bug 12: AttributeError relating to editting reviews**
- **Fix**: When loading the individual_product template, Django would throw an AttributeError because it could not find the url with the attributes passed to find the edit_review template. I fixed this by moving the url template tag from outside of the reviews for loop to inside.
- **Bug 13: Pushing to Heroku failure**
- **Fix**: Heroku would not accept my git push due to dependency conflicts between the packages botocore, python-dateutil and heroku (cli). I could not get the packages botocore and heroku to align on what version of python-dateutil they each required, so I uninstalled heroku. I then had to manually set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC in the config of the heroku dashboard instead of using heroku's cli.
- **Bug 14: Heroku 500 Server Errors on pages**
- **Fix**: On all pages but the home page my deployed app on Heroku would return a 500 internal server error. I temporarily enabled Debug and saw that Django was throwing a ProgrammingError on the pages, suggesting that the data was not pulling from the database correctly. I reinstalled the heroku package, logged in, and applied migrations specifically with the 'heroku run python' flag and then loaded the data. This resolved the issue, I then turned off Debug again.
- **Error: PEP8Online errors**
- **Fix**: A couple of my files failed PEP8 validation because of minor issues like no new line at the end of a file and lines too long. I fixed these issues and all python files now pass with 0 errors and 0 warnings.
- **Error: JavaScript linting errors**
- **Fix**: I had to insert missing colons into my JavaScript files to pass JSHint.
- **Error: WAVE accessibility errors**
- **Fix**: Global button styling had to be changed to pass colour contrast in WAVE, as well as removing empty links and adding aria attributes to certain buttons. All pages now pass WAVE with 0 errors and 0 contrast errors.
- **Error: Duplicate IDs on star rating system**
- **Fix**: Testing pages for HTML validation revealed duplicate ID attributes on the same page due to how my star rating system worked with SVGs. I tried adjusting this method but not entirely eliminate the need for IDs which would always cause duplicates in the places they were used. Instead, I adopted a CSS-based method of producing stars which used classes instead of IDs.

## Deployment

### Local deployment (clone this repository)

1. Log into your GitHub account and find [this repository](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS4_Kicks/).
2. Click on the 'Code' button (next to 'Add file').
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under clone with HTTPS, copy the link.
4. Then open Git Bash.
5. Change the current working directory to where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. In your IDE's terminal type 'git clone' followed by the URL you copied.
7. Press Enter.
8. Your local clone will now be made.
9. Please note that if you were to make a clone of this repository, you would have to gather all of the environmental variables such as access and API keys yourself and store them locally in a env.py file (do not commit this to git).

### Using Stripe

1. Create an account with [stripe](https://stripe.com/)
2. Click 'Developers' tab. 
3. Select API keys. Please note your publishable key and secret here, these will be needed in both your development and deployment environment (secret key kept secret).
4. Set your env variables based on keys mentioned above. 
5. Go to Webhooks
6. Create webhook with either your url followed by /checkout/wh/ (for your deployed env) or as a local host (for your dev env). I found the stripe-cli useful here, I was able to sign in on my terminal and set a webhook to listen to add events.
7. Test your webhook using test payments on your website.

### Using AWS (S3 Bucket)

1. Create an account with [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).
2. Select S3 bucket service, making sure to select your correct region.
3. Create new bucket, making sure to enable public access and select correct (AWS will warn you against this).
4. Add bucket policy:
![Bucket policy](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS4_Kicks/blob/main/docs/deployment/aws_bucket_policy.png)
5. Add CORS policy:
![CORS policy](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS4_Kicks/blob/main/docs/deployment/aws_cors_policy.png)
6. Set Read access for the Bucket ACL for Everyone(Public Access)
7. Go to the IAM user service.
8. Create a user group.
9. Use AWS's prebuilt policy of 'AmazonS3FullAccess' and add it to the user group as a policy permission.
10. Create new policy for the group by importing managed policy, selecting AmazonS3FullAccess and update the policy Resource to include your s3 bucket ARN.
11. Add policy to user group. 
12. Create a new user to add to the group and give them programmatic access.
13. Take note of the secret key and access key, you will need these environmental variables for your deployment.
14. Add your env variables to your settings.py. Please see the 'if 'USE_AWS' logic function at the bottom of that file for set up.

### Deployment to Heroku

1. Log in to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
2. Click 'New' on the Dashboard and select 'Create new app'.
3. Select your region and create an app name.
4. Set environment variables in your app dashboard such as SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_URL, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, EMAIL_HOST_PASS, EMAIL_HOST_USER, STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_WH_SECRET and USE_AWS.
5. To use the postgres add on and also AWS, make sure you set the variable DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 in your project so that Heroku does not collect the static for us until AWS s3 bucket is integrated in our project (see above for details on how to achieve this).
6. Use the postgres add-on in Heroku as your main database for deployment. You will need to grab the database url from Heroku and put it in your env as DATABASE_URL. Then makemigrations to this url, migrate models then load your fixtures. You can also use the heroku cli, log in to it from your terminal and do the usual heroku commands to make the migrations and load the data.
7. You can now safely deploy to Heroku by git adding, comitting then pushing to this remote directory. You can also enable automatic deployments to Heroku by going through the process of 'Connect with GitHub' in the Heroku app dashboard.


Please note: If you encounter issues in your deployment, you can use both the Heroku build logs to see issues if your project is struggling to deploy or temporarily enable the DEVELOPMENT variable in your config to momentarily allow Django to turn DEBUG on. Do make sure to remove this once you've fixed the issue.
