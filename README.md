## Scope

## Design

### Database Design

<details>
    <summary>Why use ProductGroup and ProductType models?</summary>

For the data of product group (womens, mens and kids) and type (sandals, trainers, etc) I could have used character fields in the main Products model. Instead, I opted to create separate models to hold this data to limit human error. One could easily accidentally type in "men" instead of "mens" for example, leading to issues when sorting the products later on.

## Bugs and Errors

- **Bug 1: Incorrect data types**: Product model throwing errors when attempting to make migration
- **Fix**:  Change attribute on an IntegerField from max_digits to the Django method MaxValueValidator. Add on_delete attribute to ForeignKeys. Add max_digits attribute to DecimalFields.
- **Bug 2: Searching FieldError**: When searching using the search bar Django would throw a FieldError and could not resolve 'name_icontains'.
- **Fix**: From consulting Django documentation I realised I had mistakenly only used one underscore (_) instead of two before 'icontains'.
- **Bug 3: No render of products by product_group**: My filtering method through product_group was not rendering the correct products to the HTML.
- **Fix**:Add .split() method to if statement within my product view.
- **Bug 4: Field Error on search feature**: After working successfully (see bug 2) the search feature became broken during development. When attemping to search Django would through a FieldError, 'Related Field has invalid lookup: icontains".
- **Fix**: Through research I discovered that in Django you can't use the Query object on ForeignKey database values. When I changed my product models to use a ForeignKey in place of the brand, it broke the search feature. I removed the ability to search by brand to fix this. This [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11754877/troubleshooting-related-field-has-invalid-lookup-icontains) on StackOverflow was particularly helpful in figuring this out.
- **Bug 5: Could not get both the product size and product quantity to display on template.**
- **Fix**: This involved a lot of trail and error and eventual chat to the CI support team. My first issue was that I couldn't pass the 'size' POST request data from the user to the database without manipulation of it as an integer. I then revisited the Boutique Ado code and implemented the if logic of the tutorial in my contexts.py Then the issue was twofold. 1) Through my template code I was inadvertently trying to render the entire item_data object in my code, rather than accessing just the quantity. 2) In my if statement of contexts.py I was accidentally passing the quantity value the item_data object instead of the quantity variable. Thank you to Code Institute for all their support on this bug.
- **Bug 6: Integrity Error raised on Django utilities**
- **Fix**: Data is my products model was throwing invalid foreign key errors. This was because I was trying to load the data in the incorrect order. I first changed the model name, migrated changes, then 'loaddata' in the correct order of operations.
- **Bug 7: /?product_type=socks URL not displaying any products**
- **Fix**: Investigating in the Admin dashboard I discovered that the product_type and product_brand values were contaminating each other, with the product_types only going up to 8 (socks was 9) and the rest of the data being filled in with brand names. I fixed this by moving the product_brand value in the model and fixtures, deleting the brands in the Admin dashboard and reloading the data in the appropriate order (brands first).
- **Bug 8: Inability to sort brands alphabetically by first letter**
- **Fix**: My original method of trying to sort the brands object by alphabet, then render according to first letter was using a custom template tag (|firstchar) and the zip() method on a python alphabet string and django object. See this image to see how this looked. The dual iteration loop didn't work as intended. I could render either the brand name or the alphabet string, not use them in logic to render brands organised by the string itself. I changed this methodology and used the regroup template tag to regroup the brands query set instead which worked successfully.
- **Bug 9: Stripe payment not going through**
- **Fix**: Stripe payments were not being received as Successful despite the checkout form submitting correctly. This was due to the code throwing a TypeError because I was inadvertently trying to add a float with a decimal when calculating the grand total to be submitted to Stripe. I wrapped the instance of my DELIVERY_COST variable in update_total function with a Decimal method to convert the type. This allowed the sum to be calculated correctly and payment to be submitted. 
- **Bug 10: On mobile view all pages had a blank bar of white space to the right of the screen that would trigger a horizontal scrollbar**
- **Fix**: I discovered this is a common bug with Bootstrap rows. To fix this I set a CSS rule for the root element that the 'overflow-x' be 'hidden'.
- **Bug 11: Failed migrations on brand model caused Django project to fail completely**
- **Fix**: When trying to migrate over the brand model from the products app to the brand app, I accidentally caused the whole project to fail on the server. The steps I took to fix the issue: (a) Reversed to a few commits previously (b) faked all previous migrations (c) reloaded all the data from the fixtures (d) make new migrations (e) opened a new branch to test migration attempt one step at a time. I believe I caused the bug by accidentally rewriting over an old migration which created a conflict within Django.
- **Bug 12: AttributeError relating to editting reviews**
- **Fix**: When loading the individual_product template, Django would throw an AttributeError because it could not find the url with the attributes passed to find the edit_review template. I fixed this by moving the url template tag from outside of the reviews for loop to inside.
- **Bug 13: Pushing to Heroku failure**
- **Fix**: Heroku would not accept my git push due to dependency conflicts between the packages botocore, python-dateutil and heroku (cli). I could not get the packages botocore and heroku to align on what version of python-dateutil they each required, so I uninstalled heroku. I then had to manually set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC in the config of the heroku dashboard instead of using heroku's cli.
- **Bug 14: Heroku 500 Server Errors on pages**
- **Fix**: On all pages but the home page my deployed app on Heroku would return a 500 internal server error. I temporarily enabled Debug and saw that Django was throwing a ProgrammingError on the pages, suggesting that the data was not pulling from the database correctly. I reinstalled the heroku package, logged in, and applied migrations specifically with the 'heroku run python' flag and then loaded the data. This resolved the issue, I then turned off Debug again.
- **Error: PEP8Online errors**
- **Fix**: A couple of my files failed PEP8 validation because of minor issues like no new line at the end of a file and lines too long. I fixed these issues and all python files now pass with 0 errors and 0 warnings.
- **Error: JavaScript linting errors**
- **Fix**: I had to insert missing colons into my JavaScript files to pass JSHint.
- **Error: WAVE accessibility errors**
- **Fix**: Global button styling had to be changed to pass colour contrast in WAVE, as well as removing empty links and adding aria attributes to certain buttons. All pages now pass WAVE with 0 errors and 0 contrast errors.
- **Error: Duplicate IDs on star rating system**
- **Fix**: Testing pages for HTML validation revealed duplicate ID attributes on the same page due to how my star rating system worked with SVGs. I tried adjusting this method but not entirely eliminate the need for IDs which would always cause duplicates in the places they were used. Instead, I adopted a CSS-based method of producing stars which used classes instead of IDs.
