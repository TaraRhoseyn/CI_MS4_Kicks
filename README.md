## Scope

## Design

### Database Design

**Database physical model:**

This physical model contains all databse collections, data types and relations to one another:

![Database physical model](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS4_Kicks/blob/main/docs/design/database_diagram.png)

#### Models

**Product model**

- Core model containing all information about products.
- Contains the fields: sku, name, description, product_group, product_type, product_brand, price, default_rating, image_url, image and has_sizes.
- The sku field naming convention is based on sku architecture principles. The first two letters are product type, e.g. "TRAINERS", the next two are brand, e.g. "NIKE", the next two are product grouping, e.g. "CHILDRENS, the next number the default rating, e.g. "3", and the last letters the colour, e.g. "BLUE". For example, the first product's sku is "TRANICH3BL". I learnt about sku architecture from this [blog post](https://www.shopify.co.uk/retail/what-is-a-sku-number) from Shopify. I sped up production of sku fields by using the [Gorgias SKU Generator](https://www.gorgias.com/tools/sku-generator).
- The image_url field is used to store the AWS s3 bucket url which holds the product's image.

**ProductType model**

- Contains all of the product types, for example Trainers, Daps, Brogues etc. These types are used to help users filter to which products they may be interested in.
- Contains the fields: name, friendly_name.
- This could have been a CharField in the Product model, but I opted to create separate models to hold this data to limit human error.

**ProductGroup model**

- Contains all of the product types, for example Mens, Womens etc. These groups are used to help users filter to which products would suit them.
- Contains the fields: name, friendly_name.
- This could have been a CharField in the Product model, but I opted to create separate models to hold this data to limit human error.

**Brand model**

- Contains all 54 brands whose products are used in this project.
- Contains the fields: name, friendly_name.
- This could have been a CharField in the Product model, but (a) I wanted to limit human error and (b) I was creating seperate views for a brands app so it made more sense to keep the Brand model in the same app rather than be part of Product in the products app.

**Review**

- Contains all product reviews left by users. Reviews can be left by regular users or superusers. Regular users can edit or delete their own reviews, while superusers can edit or delete any reviews. Going forward I would like to use this model to upload the default_rating field on the Product model to replace the admin-input of ratings and have users be able to quickly see an aggregated rating for the product as well as individual reviews.
- Contains the fields: text_review, star_rating, created_at, created_by, product

**Favourite**

- Stores products favourited by a specific user. 
- Contains the fields: product, created_by

**UserProfile**

- Contains delivery information and the user. 
- Contains the fields: user, default_phone_number, default_street_address1, default_street_address2, default_town_or_city, default_county,  default_postcode, default_country

**User**

- This is a model created by the Django allauth library.
- Contains the fields: username, password, first_name, last_name, is_staff, is_active, is_superuser, last_login, date_joined

**Order**

- Contains all key order information such as delivery information, shopping bag and total of order.
- Contains the fields: user_profile, order_number, full_name, email, phone_number, country, postcode, town_or_city, street_address_1, street_address_2, county, date, delivery_cost, order_total, grand_total, original_bag, stripe_pid

**OrderLineItem**

- Contains information about specific products in regards to orders being made.
- Contains the fields: order, product, product_size, quantity, lineitem_total

### Visual Design

#### Colour Scheme

The following colours were chosen to be the main colours of the website due to their association with youth culture and street fashion, particularly the yellow and purple. I wanted to create a vibrant and fun brand. 

![Colour scheme](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS4_Kicks/blob/main/docs/design/colour_scheme.png)

Other colours are used in other sections of the site such as a neon green or neutral grey, but these are the core colours.

#### Typography

The main heading font is Outfit (with generic sans-serif if font fails) and the main body text is Outfit, with a tertiary font of Rubik Mono One. [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used for the typography. I chose these fonts due to there high readability and comptability across browsers.

#### Imagery

All of the images used are fully copyright-free images (please see the [media.md](/docs/media.md) markdown file for more details). 

The imagery is fun, bright and vibrant product photography. Imagery is used a lot throughout the website to keep the website visually engaging and give users as much visual information about the product as possible.

Users viewing their favourites and choice to un-favourite them:

![Feature 8](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS4_Kicks/blob/main/docs/features/feature_8.png)

**Feature 9: Reviews**

Reviews can be left by regular users or superusers. Regular users can edit or delete their own reviews, while superusers can edit or delete any reviews. Going forward I would like to use this model to upload the default_rating field on the Product model to replace the admin-input of ratings and have users be able to quickly see an aggregated rating for the product as well as individual reviews. Please see future features for details on improvements to this feature.

How to leave a review and view other reviews on the individual_product view (under the product descriptions):

Users can checkout, place an order and pay for the items in their shopping bag. Users can get to checkout through the bag page. Once it's gone through users will receive a confirmation email too.

The checkout page:

![Feature 11](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS4_Kicks/blob/main/docs/features/feature_11.png)

Confirmation of checkout:

![Feature 11](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS4_Kicks/blob/main/docs/features/feature_11_success.png)

**Feature 12: Profile**

The profile page lets users see their order history, update their default delivery information and view their favourites.

![Feature 12](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS4_Kicks/blob/main/docs/features/feature_12.png)

**Feature 13: Product management**

Superusers can add products or delete and edit all products natively in the website without going through to the Admin. 

Products can be editted or deleted from the individual_product view:

![Feature 13](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS4_Kicks/blob/main/docs/features/feature_13_mgt_view_product.png)

Products can be added through the Product Management view accessible via the account icon drop down menu in the navbar:

![Feature 13](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS4_Kicks/blob/main/docs/features/feature_13.png)

**Feature 14: Admin**

Superusers can go to the /admin/ url and log into the Django admin dashboard where they have full CRUD functionality across the website with all database models.

![Feature 14](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS4_Kicks/blob/main/docs/features/feature_14.png)

**Feature 15: Filter products by price**

All products can be filtered by price to go from high to low or low to high, as indicated by the arrow icons. 

Going forward, I would like to apply more obvious styling to the selected params to let users know more clearly which filter they currently have selected if any.

![Feature 15](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS4_Kicks/blob/main/docs/features/feature_15.png)

**Feature 16: Filter products by rating**

All products can be filtered by rating to go from high to low. I decided against putting a low to high option because I don't see a reason why a user would wish to see the lowest rated item.

Going forward, I would like to apply more obvious styling to the selected params to let users know more clearly which filter they currently have selected if any.

![Feature 15](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS4_Kicks/blob/main/docs/features/feature_15.png)

**Feature 17: Women's products page**

Superuser's view:

![Feature 20](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS4_Kicks/blob/main/docs/features/feature_2_superuser.png)

**Feature 22: Toasts for user feedback**

Four different types of toasts (info, error, success and warning) exist to let users know when they have updated, added or deleted any significant piece of data, such as adding an item to the shopping bag.

![Feature 21](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS4_Kicks/blob/main/docs/features/feature_21.png)

- **Fix**:  Change attribute on an IntegerField from max_digits to the Django method MaxValueValidator. Add on_delete attribute to ForeignKeys. Add max_digits attribute to DecimalFields.
- **Bug 2: Searching FieldError**: When searching using the search bar Django would throw a FieldError and could not resolve 'name_icontains'.
- **Fix**: From consulting Django documentation I realised I had mistakenly only used one underscore (_) instead of two before 'icontains'.
- **Bug 3: No render of products by product_group**: My filtering method through product_group was not rendering the correct products to the HTML.
- **Fix**:Add .split() method to if statement within my product view.
- **Bug 4: Field Error on search feature**: After working successfully (see bug 2) the search feature became broken during development. When attemping to search Django would through a FieldError, 'Related Field has invalid lookup: icontains".
- **Fix**: Through research I discovered that in Django you can't use the Query object on ForeignKey database values. When I changed my product models to use a ForeignKey in place of the brand, it broke the search feature. I removed the ability to search by brand to fix this. This [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11754877/troubleshooting-related-field-has-invalid-lookup-icontains) on StackOverflow was particularly helpful in figuring this out.
- **Bug 5: Could not get both the product size and product quantity to display on template.**
- **Fix**: This involved a lot of trail and error and eventual chat to the CI support team. My first issue was that I couldn't pass the 'size' POST request data from the user to the database without manipulation of it as an integer. I then revisited the Boutique Ado code and implemented the if logic of the tutorial in my contexts.py Then the issue was twofold. 1) Through my template code I was inadvertently trying to render the entire item_data object in my code, rather than accessing just the quantity. 2) In my if statement of contexts.py I was accidentally passing the quantity value the item_data object instead of the quantity variable. Thank you to Code Institute for all their support on this bug.
- **Bug 6: Integrity Error raised on Django utilities**
- **Fix**: Data is my products model was throwing invalid foreign key errors. This was because I was trying to load the data in the incorrect order. I first changed the model name, migrated changes, then 'loaddata' in the correct order of operations.
- **Bug 7: /?product_type=socks URL not displaying any products**
- **Fix**: Investigating in the Admin dashboard I discovered that the product_type and product_brand values were contaminating each other, with the product_types only going up to 8 (socks was 9) and the rest of the data being filled in with brand names. I fixed this by moving the product_brand value in the model and fixtures, deleting the brands in the Admin dashboard and reloading the data in the appropriate order (brands first).
- **Bug 8: Inability to sort brands alphabetically by first letter**
- **Fix**: My original method of trying to sort the brands object by alphabet, then render according to first letter was using a custom template tag (|firstchar) and the zip() method on a python alphabet string and django object. See this image to see how this looked. The dual iteration loop didn't work as intended. I could render either the brand name or the alphabet string, not use them in logic to render brands organised by the string itself. I changed this methodology and used the regroup template tag to regroup the brands query set instead which worked successfully.
- **Bug 9: Stripe payment not going through**
- **Fix**: Stripe payments were not being received as Successful despite the checkout form submitting correctly. This was due to the code throwing a TypeError because I was inadvertently trying to add a float with a decimal when calculating the grand total to be submitted to Stripe. I wrapped the instance of my DELIVERY_COST variable in update_total function with a Decimal method to convert the type. This allowed the sum to be calculated correctly and payment to be submitted. 
- **Bug 10: On mobile view all pages had a blank bar of white space to the right of the screen that would trigger a horizontal scrollbar**
- **Fix**: I discovered this is a common bug with Bootstrap rows. To fix this I set a CSS rule for the root element that the 'overflow-x' be 'hidden'.
- **Bug 11: Failed migrations on brand model caused Django project to fail completely**
- **Fix**: When trying to migrate over the brand model from the products app to the brand app, I accidentally caused the whole project to fail on the server. The steps I took to fix the issue: (a) Reversed to a few commits previously (b) faked all previous migrations (c) reloaded all the data from the fixtures (d) make new migrations (e) opened a new branch to test migration attempt one step at a time. I believe I caused the bug by accidentally rewriting over an old migration which created a conflict within Django.
- **Bug 12: AttributeError relating to editting reviews**
- **Fix**: When loading the individual_product template, Django would throw an AttributeError because it could not find the url with the attributes passed to find the edit_review template. I fixed this by moving the url template tag from outside of the reviews for loop to inside.
- **Bug 13: Pushing to Heroku failure**
- **Fix**: Heroku would not accept my git push due to dependency conflicts between the packages botocore, python-dateutil and heroku (cli). I could not get the packages botocore and heroku to align on what version of python-dateutil they each required, so I uninstalled heroku. I then had to manually set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC in the config of the heroku dashboard instead of using heroku's cli.
- **Bug 14: Heroku 500 Server Errors on pages**
- **Fix**: On all pages but the home page my deployed app on Heroku would return a 500 internal server error. I temporarily enabled Debug and saw that Django was throwing a ProgrammingError on the pages, suggesting that the data was not pulling from the database correctly. I reinstalled the heroku package, logged in, and applied migrations specifically with the 'heroku run python' flag and then loaded the data. This resolved the issue, I then turned off Debug again.
- **Error: PEP8Online errors**
- **Fix**: A couple of my files failed PEP8 validation because of minor issues like no new line at the end of a file and lines too long. I fixed these issues and all python files now pass with 0 errors and 0 warnings.
- **Error: JavaScript linting errors**
- **Fix**: I had to insert missing colons into my JavaScript files to pass JSHint.
- **Error: WAVE accessibility errors**
- **Fix**: Global button styling had to be changed to pass colour contrast in WAVE, as well as removing empty links and adding aria attributes to certain buttons. All pages now pass WAVE with 0 errors and 0 contrast errors.
- **Error: Duplicate IDs on star rating system**
- **Fix**: Testing pages for HTML validation revealed duplicate ID attributes on the same page due to how my star rating system worked with SVGs. I tried adjusting this method but not entirely eliminate the need for IDs which would always cause duplicates in the places they were used. Instead, I adopted a CSS-based method of producing stars which used classes instead of IDs.
